<h1>Procedure for Academic Appeals</h1>

<h2>School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences (Approved April 3, 2017)</h2>

This policy covers student academic appeals on grades, made to the Associate Dean of
the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences (in lieu of a Chair), under
Academic Regulation 12 of the UPEI Calendar.

As per Academic Regulation 12, the student must make the appeal, in writing using the
SMCS Academic Appeal Form ([PDF](smcs_academic_appeal_form.pdf)/[WORD](smcs_academic_appeal_form.docx)), within one week of the instructor’s decision on the
informal appeal. This must contain a detailed rationale for the appeal. Appeals must be
based on the principle(s) of bias and/or unfairness (typically with respect to the grading
process) that have not been addressed by the instructor, and the reasoning behind the
student’s belief that this is the case must be clearly explained. 

The School will not
entertain appeals based solely on the principle of the instructor’s choices in marking
criteria (assuming these criteria have been equally applied within the course). The
School will not entertain appeals that it determines to be frivolous or vexatious.
In the event of an appeal being made concerning a grade assigned by the Associate
Dean, the Associate Dean will appoint another School faculty member to act as arbiter
of the appeal.

The Associate Dean (or arbiter) may request a meeting with the student to clarify the
details of the appeal.
In cases where a grade(s) on a specific exam, test, project, assignment, etc. is (are) being
appealed, the Associate Dean (or arbiter) shall ask the instructor to supply up to two
additional examples of work(s) that was (were) scored approximately equally (for
comparison purposes), if available.

In all cases, the Associate Dean (or arbiter) will form an ad-hoc committee, consisting of
two additional faculty members (regular and/or sessional, other than the course
instructor) to examine the validity of the appeal.
The Associate Dean (or arbiter) shall render a decision to the student as promptly as
possible, preferably within 2 weeks of receiving the appeal.
