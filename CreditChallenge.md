<h1>Challenge for Credit Policy</h1>
<h2>School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (Approved April 3, 2017)</h2>

<h3>Scope</h3>
The University of Prince Edward Island’s Academic Regulation 15 deals with challenge
for course credit. This document extends Regulation 15 in the context of the School of
Mathematical and Computational Sciences.
The School recognizes that some students may have achieved competence in certain
subject areas through experience gained elsewhere. This experience may consist of
courses taken at other institutions (for which UPEI transfer credit was not granted), self-
study or skills acquired through employment. Challenge for credit is an option for these
students. Academic Regulation 15 imposes a limit of 12 semester hours of challenge
credit.

<h3>Policy</h3>
As prescribed by Regulation 15, the School maintains a list of courses that are eligible to
challenge for credit. No course outside of this list may be challenged. Challenge for
credit is not permitted for co-op or internship courses.
Regulation 15 states that “No challenge for credit will be accepted when any attempt
has been made within the previous ten years to earn credit in the course, or an
equivalent course, whether by challenge or otherwise.” The School interprets “attempt”
in a way that includes the following:
• The course was audited
• The student participated in the course (in any way) beyond the final day for late
registration and course changes.
The School is responsible for choosing the appropriate method of evaluation, which may
consist of written, practical and/or oral components. A grade of 70% must be attained
in this evaluation in order to “Pass” the challenge.
Normally, challenge for credit exams will be written during the formal exam period.
