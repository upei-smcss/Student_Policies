<h1>Course Transfer Policy</h1>
<h2>School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences (Approved April 3, 2017) </h2>

The University of Prince Edward Island has regulations concerning the transfer of course
credit from other institutions - cf. Regulation 14 of the Academic Calendar. This
document is not meant to supersede this policy, but rather to clarify it with respect to
the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences.

The School wishes to stress that transfer of credit from another institution, even
another Canadian university, is not a given. The School must evaluate courses to ensure
that they are acceptable within our program (both in content and evaluation standards)
and acceptance is not guaranteed. Students may be required to provide a detailed
syllabus of the course in question, including a certified translation if requested. To
ensure acceptance of a potential transfer credit, students who are already enrolled at
UPEI must consult with the department before taking a course at another institution.
This should be done through consultation with the Associate Dean of the School
