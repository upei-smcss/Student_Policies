<h1>Application of Academic Regulation 1(k)</h1>

From the University Calendar, Undergraduate Academic Regulation 1(k) states:

Double-counting is the practice of having one course satisfy the requirements of two different and
concurrent designations within one degree. The following limitations apply: In the case of a major and a
minor, a maximum of six semester hours of credit can be double-counted. In the case of a double major,
a maximum of nine semester hours of credit can be double-counted. Note: Although a course may be
used to meet more than one requirement within a degree, credit is only counted once.

For each major within SMCS, the School has determined a list of major courses (minimum 42 credit
hours) to be used in the application of the above regulation. Thus for any specific major, the courses on
that majorâ€™s list may only be double-counted with at most six semester hours of credit from a minor or
at most nine semester hours of credit from another major.
